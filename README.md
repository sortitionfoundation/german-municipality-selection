This software code can be run by installing all dependency packages and running the `notebook.py` script. The script is in fact a Jupyter notebook in percent format, so use the package `jupytext` to convert to a normal `ipynb` format or open with `jupyterlab`.

Dependencies can be installed from the `poetry.lock` file using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) via:
```
poetry install
```

Alternatively, the following packages are required:
```
pip install jupyterlab pandas openpyxl voting samplics requests plotly kaleido
```

For any questions, please refer directly to the Sortition Foundation via email.
